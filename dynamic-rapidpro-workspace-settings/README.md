# dynamic-rapidpro-workspace Shared GitHub Action
The `dynamic-rapidpro-workspace-settings` is a parameterised reusable GitHub action that updates app-settings prior to compiling and uploading to a running CHT app.

### Background
This action is relevant for CHT apps that have either [outbound](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/outbound/) integrations with RapidPro or logic that requires RapidPro workspace data GUIDs.
Normally, you would want a staging deployment to use the staging workspace and a production deployment to use the corresponding production workspace. This action automates the process of updating `app_settings.json` to use relevant UUIDs.

### How it works
1. It adds the configured `value_key` to CouchDBâ€™s config storage to securely store the [credentials](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/outbound/#credentials).
2. This action automatically updates the following details in outbound modules:
   - `base_url` and `value_key`
   - contact group UUID, if using the [groups endpoint](https://rapidpro.app.medicmobile.org/api/v2/groups). Note that the action was tested with one group.
   - flow UUID, if using the [flow starts endpoint](https://rapidpro.app.medicmobile.org/api/v2/flow_starts). Note that the action was tested with one flow in two modules.
3. It replaces contents of a file, `flows.js`, in the project repository with flow UUIDs obtained from RapidPro workspace through the API. To extract the UUIDs, you can simply use the API explorer, under `/api/v2/flows.json`. A sample `flows.js` would be as follows:

```
module.exports = {
  sample_flow_1_uuid: '3f6a48d3-703a-493b-bb10-f4a38a442cda',
  sample_flow_2_uuid: '064107cf-9bc5-4042-a657-825fdb5a92a4',
  ...
};
```

> **This action can be executed jointly with other Github actions like [deploy-with-medic-conf](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/.github/actions/deploy-with-medic-conf). However, it must be executed before other actions to update dependencies prior to compiling app settings.** 

## CHT App Requirements
* cht-conf@3.3 or above
